# Build your own UI

## Create a custom sign-up and sign-in page

Clerk provides [sample code](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-nextjs-examples) for different types of authentication flows you might need for your application. Each example is a fully runnable application which you can use either as a starter or a guideline on how you can utilize Clerk based on your requirements. In each example folder, you will find instructions on how to bootstrap the application.
